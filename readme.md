# ✍️ Handwritten Digit Recognition

This project is a **Handwritten Digit Recognition Model** built using **TensorFlow**.The model Recognizes digits (0–9) from handwritten input.The model is trained on the popular **MNIST** dataset and can accurately identify digits from images.While training we got the highest model accuracy to be **ACCURACY = 99%**..

## Overview

-  Uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for high accuracy
-  Trained on 60,000+ handwritten digit images
- Built using TensorFlow and Keras
-  Accuracy: ~99% on test set
- Deployed with flask
